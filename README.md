# AES-128 Implmentation

Don't use this on production!

This is my own AES-128 implmentation from scratch in Python.

I will include in the future all AES modes modules working with this implmentation.

## Usage
Inside aes-128 folder:
```python
from aes128.main import aes128_encrypt, aes128_decrypt

key = b"1234567890123456" # 16 bytes
pt  = b"gal_is_the_best_" # 16 bytes

ct = aes128_encrypt(key, pt)
decrypted_ct = aes128_decrypt(key, ct)
```
